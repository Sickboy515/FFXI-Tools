# Dragon Watch

This is a utility to keep track of Domain Invasion Mobs. It's based on chat filter and could probably use a lot of cleanup.  This is based on specific unities and certain key words in the pop/timer phrases.  Please help edit by looking at the map.lua and adding in each unity and some syntax that would help identify the spawn phrases.
