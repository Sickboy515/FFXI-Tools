Commands:  
takopop vw - attempts to locate a planar rift within interact range, and if it does, trades cells and displacers to the rift.  
  
Settings:  
At the top of the .lua file, you will find some settings, such as how many cells to buy, which to buy, how many to use, as well as how many displacers to use.
