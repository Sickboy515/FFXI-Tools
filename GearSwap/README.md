Please note this is a collection of my LUA's.   Much of this work is borrowed from all around the Final Fantasy community and much of it is home grown by me.  Please use to your hearts content and ask me on ffxiah for any support.   Much of this code is very raw, uncommented, and ugly but generally "works".  It's often spun into a lot of custom crap I'm working on in between lua's - so your mileage may vary.   The intent is to be a 'guide' of what you can do.
